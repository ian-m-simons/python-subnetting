Plan: 
	#This Program will provide subnetting automation
	#It can do this either by pulling the network information from the machine it is running on or by user input

TODO:
	#finish pulling in network information 
	#allow user input for IP address info and verify information is accurate 
	#write subnetting portion (will likely pull logic from past projects https://github.com/ian-m-simons/powershell-subnetting)
