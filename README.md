Plan: 
	This Program will provide subnetting automation
	It can do this either by pulling the network information from the machine it is running on or by user input

TODO:
	>verify information IP Address and subnet mask provided from the user are valid
	>add better error handling
	>add functionality for further subnetting networks which have already been subnetted
	>add functionality for supernetting
